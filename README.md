# Xperimental

Nanjizal has grown. So here is a place to collate smaller projects and provide more natative on the experiments the development of concepts through experiments.

## Animation

### Zeal of Zebra
Using my **Leaf** offset rotations, **folders** image/file **helper** and my port of **RectPack2D**. 

 - [ WebGL ](https://nanjizal.github.io/Xperimental/zealAtlas/bin/index.html) _mouse down and <- -> to rotate piece._
 - [ Canvas ](https://nanjizal.github.io/Zeal/deploy/index.html)

#### Zeal Development 
[From the Canvas version to the WebGL, with some Texture packing and Ascii art diversions, read more.. > ](/information/ZealOfZebra.md)

### Ascii Art, hxPixel and Ansi

[In my exploration of Zeal I wanted quick display of images within the console, read more..](https://github.com/nanjizal/Xperimental/blob/master/information/ZealOfZebra.md#ansi-and-asciihxpixels-art-diversions)

## JigsawX

- [ WebGL ](https://nanjizal.github.io/TrilateralBazaar/jigsawX/bin/index.html)
- [ Canvas/Dom ](https://nanjizal.github.io/JigsawX/bin/JigsawDivtastic.htm)

_Flash, Swing, OpenFL, NME, Kha and Canvas versions, some with webcam or video._

## Trilateral drawing contours with WebGL ( GL ).

## Tetris, triangle crazy.
I was asked if I could make Tetris, implemented it with triangles not an MVC framework! You can define your own shapes in the code easily and it runs on all Haxe toolkits, did add SVG target but meh, also emscriptem via NME. Two versions below.
_Arrow keys to play._
- [ WebGL ](https://nanjizal.github.io/PolyominoTriangles/binHeaps/index.html)
- [ Canvas ](https://nanjizal.github.io/PolyominoTriangles/binCanvas/index.html?2)

## hxSpiro
Port of Spiro a fancy tool for making intuative curves.
- [ code pen demo ](https://codepen.io/Nanjizal/pen/qReLLR)

_TODO: upload better version to github as the code pen one move points is broken._

## L-Systems 
greatly improved this project adding cool examples, animation and implementing color and abstracting so it will work for Kha and Luxe.
